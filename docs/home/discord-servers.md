# Discord Servers
Here at the Foundation, we have a couple of Discord servers that are publicly available to join. These are listed below, along with their descriptions.

There are also some invite-only Discord servers, but these are primarily dependent on the position you hold in the Foundation. For example, if you are a member of the Security Department, you will be granted access to the Security Department Discord server. Invite-only links are handed out via direct messages or are posted within a Discord channel you'll gain access to when you have the appropriate user tags.

## Main
[https://discord.gg/t5qpY533qd](https://discord.gg/t5qpY533qd)

This is the main Discord server for the Foundation. It is the first place of entry for members, so everyone is invited! Announcements, updates, and general discussions are posted/held here.

It is a requirement for all personnel to be within the main Discord server and their department Discord servers to keep up-to-date. Anyone who is not within their relevant Discord servers is at risk of being removed from their position entirely.

### Verification
In order to verify or reverify your account, please use the command "**!verify**" within a Discord channel. A message will be sent detailing instructions for this process.

### Roles
Discord roles and nicknames for members of the community are automatically set when you speak in a channel. There is a cooldown of 10 minutes before checking what tags and nickname should be set for your Discord account. This is to reduce API requests sent to the verification server.

A verified Roblox account must be linked with your Discord account in order to receive Discord roles. For information on how to do this, please see the section on [verification](#verification).
